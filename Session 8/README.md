# Session 8

## üìñ Overview

Today's session was the first in our cloud series.

We started by answering an important question. What is the cloud? And why does it exist.

We dove deep into the difficulties and restrictions of using a public cloud and looked at the different at the different types of cloud computing.

<br />

| Type    |          Location          |                              Pros                              |                          Cons                           |
| ------- | :------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |
| Public  | Cloud Provider Datacenter  |                Reliable, Cheapest, Less Complex                |        Security Hazard, Limited Overall Control         |
| Private |  Datacenter / On-Premise   | Tightest Security, Higher Performance, Highest Overall Control | Most Expensive, Limited Scalability, Highest Complexity |
| Hybrid  | Mixed Datacenter / Premise |         Tighter Security, Higher Performance, Reliable         |            More Expensive, Higher Complexity            |

Afterwords we learned the pay as you go model and the issues that cloud computing was trying to fix.

We also discussed how cloud computing powers many of our mobile apps without you know and the practical reason behind it.

And by the end of the session we used our newly acquired knowledge to create, provision and configure a database using Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and connect to it using postbird.

And by the end of session we learned about the meaning of deployment and the steps needed to successfully deploy an application using our app. _Udacity Hub_ as an example.
