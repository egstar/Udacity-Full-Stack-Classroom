# Session 5

## üìñ Overview

In today's session, we learned the fundamentals of migrations.

We learned about why they exists and the problems they are trying to solve.

We discussed how to create them from scratch and how they work in the inside.

We also learned what are environment variables and the problems they solve.

We dove deep into our applications architecture and through our brainstorm we created a cohesive database design that suits our needs.

We learned the use cases of a many to many relationship and how to both visualize it and implement it in a meaningful way.

We also took a sneak peak at the meaning of CRUD and discussed which operations should we implement into our application.
